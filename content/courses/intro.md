## Overview

Build a strong software development foundation and learn how to use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various libraries to create fully-functional web apps.

This course guides students toward developing a well-rounded foundation of skills necessary for modern web development. These skills include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript coding; utilizing Git workflow processes; project organization; designing with wireframing; and employing introductory Agile development methods.

This part-time evening track is 24 hours of hands-on classroom activity in total. Course hours include lecture, lab, mentoring.  Homework and graded assignments will be assigned for hours outside of the classroom.

## Outcomes

At the end of this course, you will:

* Define the structure of a web page utilizing the semantic hierarchical structural conventions of HTML5.

* Apply CSS and HTML to implement page layout styles including grid, fluid, and responsive techniques; and to style content with color, typography, and images.

* Utilize Javascript to make web projects interactive, such that user input is stored and processed to create updated and personalized content when a user interacts with a page.

* Write JavaScript that leverages the fundamentals of Computer Science, the Object-Oriented Programming paradigm, basic data types, data structures, and basic algorithms, so that the code is efficient, error-free, and matches commonly accepted standards and practices of syntax and style, as measured by the code’s functionality and ability to pass a code linter.

* Utilize industry standard version control tools and workflows, including Git and GitHub, to write functional, properly styled code and to work efficiently and harmoniously in professional environments.
