* Apply CSS and HTML to implement page layout styles including grid, fluid, and responsive techniques; and to style content with color, typography, and images.

* Utilize Javascript to make web projects interactive, such that user input is stored and processed to create updated and personalized content when a user interacts with a page.

* Write JavaScript that leverages the fundamentals of Computer Science, the Object-Oriented Programming paradigm, basic data types, data structures, and basic algorithms, so that the code is efficient, error-free, and matches commonly accepted standards and practices of syntax and style, as measured by the codeâ€™s functionality and ability to pass a code linter.
